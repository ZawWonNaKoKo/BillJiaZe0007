# Problem Definition

What model best suits to predict the laptop price
What factor/spec affects the laptop Price

# Models Used

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random forest

# Conclusion
● Laptop using Mac OS tend to have highest price. (Brand effect)
● Majority of Laptop type of 'Gaming Machine' & 'Work station' are on higher price range, as 
a result of additional software support and specialized hardware configurations. (Outliers 
effect)
● Intel’s CPU & Nvidia’s GPU tend to have the highest price in their respective markets.
● Finally the price of laptop are highly correlated with its RAM, PPI (or Screen Resolution) 
and the speed performance of CPU.

# What we have learnt:
● Data Cleaning Techniques
● Linear Regression;
● Decision Tree;
● Random Forest.
Random forests consist of multiple single trees each based on a random sample of the training 
data, so that it is typically more accurate than single decision tree
